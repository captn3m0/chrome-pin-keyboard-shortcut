Chrome Extension that uses the Tab Pinning API. Enables a new keyboard
shortcut (Ctrl + Shift + A) to toggle pinning and unpinning of the current tab.

Needs the Experimental API Flag. Two ways to get it:

- Use Dev chrome channel
- Enable Experimental Extension APIs in chrome://flags

This extension can not be uploaded right now to the Chrome Store, but I will do so as soon as possible.
It is derived from the Sample Chrome extension available [here](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/samples#keyboard-pin), the only difference
being a change in keyboard shortcut to the more convenient (Ctrl+Shift+A).
